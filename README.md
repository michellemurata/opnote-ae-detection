# OpNote-AE: Automated Detection of Intraoperative Adverse Events from Spine Operative Notes

## Overview

This repository contains code for automated detection of intraoperative adverse events from spine surgery operative reports using a large language model (LLM).

The system identifies:

* Incidental (unplanned) durotomy
* Non-durotomy intraoperative adverse events

This code accompanies the manuscript:

> **“GPT-4-Assisted Detection of Intraoperative Adverse Events from Spine Surgery Operative Reports: A Comparison with Human Reviewers”**

## Model Information

This pipeline was developed using GPT-4 accessed through the Azure OpenAI API.

Model behavior and performance may vary depending on:

* Model version or deployment
* Prompt configuration
* Sampling parameters
* Dataset characteristics

---

## Requirements

Python 3.9 or higher

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## API Access

This project requires access to the Azure OpenAI API.

Set environment variables before running:

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=YOUR_ENDPOINT
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
```

Running this pipeline requires paid API usage. Costs depend on dataset size and model pricing.

---

## Data

Real operative notes cannot be shared due to patient privacy restrictions.

A synthetic example dataset is provided:

```
example_data/synthetic_oper_notes.csv
```

Users may substitute their own dataset in the same format.

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA) when applying this code to clinical text.

## Running the Pipeline

From the repository root:

```bash
python src/detect_adverse_events.py \
  --input_csv example_data/synthetic_oper_notes.csv \
  --output_csv results/sample_predictions.csv \
  --prompt_name adverse_event
```

---

## Output

The pipeline produces a CSV file containing:

* Predicted adverse event classification
* Additional model response details
* Raw model outputs

---

## Prompts

Prompt templates are located in the `prompts/` directory and can be modified for different classification tasks.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

Results may vary across runs due to:

* Model updates
* API behavior
* Non-deterministic sampling
* Differences in input datasets
